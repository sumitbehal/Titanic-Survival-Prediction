# Titanic-Visualization
For my data visualization project I am using the famous "Titanic" dataset which contains demographics and passenger information for 891 passengers out of total 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The data file contains information such as Passenger class (socio-economic status), Sex, Age, Number of Sibling/Spouse/Parent/Children travelling with them. The purpose of the visualization is primarily explanatory, which aims at displaying the statistics of people who died and survived based on their socio-economic status (First, Second or Third class), their sex (Male or Female) and various other factors.
